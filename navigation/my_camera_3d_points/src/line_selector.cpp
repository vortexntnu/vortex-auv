select which line is the active line to follow
filter the lines into active and next line. Lines recieved as a pose stamped message
recieving lines as 3d endpoints 
donn| know het whhere start and end, use orientation of camera to decide with x/y coord


kham has transformed points to 3d
function that uses the 2d ponints, and sorts/groups the points to a line in camera frame
recieving either 0, 2 or 4 points for line, as poseArray
