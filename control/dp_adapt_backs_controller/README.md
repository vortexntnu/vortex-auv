## DP Adaptive Backstepping Controller

This package implements a dynamic positioning (DP) Adaptive backstepping controller for the orca AUV. It estimates the linear and nonlinear damping using adaptive parameters, and compensates for uncertainties and disturbances in real-time in the same manner as a state estimator. The proof for this is done using Lyapunov functions and stability requirements to ensure convergence and stability.

### Overview
- Uses the backstepping control method for position and orientation control
- Includes adaptive terms to account for unmodeled dynamics and uncertainties.

### Model for AUV

```math
\dot{\eta} = J(\eta)\nu,
```

```math
M \dot{\nu} + C(\nu)\,\nu - F(\nu, \Theta^\star) = \tau + d^\star
```

- $\nu$: Body-fixed velocity vector
- $\eta$: Inertial position and orientation vector
- M: Constant mass-inertia matrix
- C($\eta$): Coriolis and centripetal terms
- J($\eta$): Transformation from body to inertial coordinates
- F($\nu$, $\Theta^\star$) =  Y($\nu$) $\Theta^\star$: The damping assumed damping function (linear and nonlinear), where Y(*) describes the behaviour
- $d^\star$: Disturbance and uncertainties

## Backstepping controller

Using the Lyapunov proof we get the following functions for the backstepping controller:

##### Backstepping variables

```math
z_1 = \eta - \eta_d
```

```math
z_2 = \nu - \alpha
```

where the $\alpha$ is defined as the function that stabilizes the $z_1$ variable in the Lyapunov function system.

##### Adaptive parameters

```math
\tilde{\Theta} = \hat{\Theta} - \Theta^\star
```

```math
\tilde{d} = \hat{d} - d^\star
```

where:

- $\Theta^\star$ and $d^\star$ are the actual parameters,
- $\hat{\Theta}$ and $\hat{d}$ are the estimated parameters,
- $\tilde{\Theta}$ and $\tilde{d}$ are the estimation errors.

#### Proof of control law

We define the Lyapunov function candidate (LFC) as:

```math
V_1 = \frac{1}{2} z_1^\top z_1
```

By fulfilling the criteriums of RUB, positive definite and \(V_1(0) = 0\), we need to do a derivation and ensure negative definite.

Taking the derivative of the Lyapunov function candidate \(V_1\):

```math
\dot{V}_1 = \frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{1}{2} z_1^\top z_1 \right)
```

Using the chain rule, we get:

```math
\dot{V}_1 = z_1^\top \dot{z}_1
```

Substitute $\dot{z}_1$ with the dynamics of $z_1$:

```math
\dot{z}_1 = \dot{\eta} - \dot{\eta}_d
```

and then inserting in the relation:

```math
\dot{\eta} = J(\eta)\nu
```

```math
\dot{z}_1 = J(\eta)\nu - \dot{\eta}_d
```

and
```math
\nu = z_2 + \alpha
```
Thus, the derivative of the Lyapunov function candidate is:
```math
\dot{V}_1 = z_1^\top J(\eta)(z_2 + \alpha)
```

We also assume that $\dot{\eta_d} = 0$ since we only get a desired position and orientation ($\eta$).

We choose an $\alpha$ value to make $z_1$ be negative semi-definite.

```math
\boxed{
\alpha = -J(\eta)^{-1}(K_1 z_1)
}
```

```math
\dot{V}_1 = z_1^\top J(\eta)z_2 - z_1^\top K_1 z_1 < 0
```

We will now define the rest of the Lyapunov function candidates, including the adaptive parameter.

```math
V_2 = \frac{1}{2} z_2^\top M z_2
```

For the second backstepping variable:

```math
V_{\theta} = \frac{1}{2} \tilde{\Theta}^\top \Gamma^{-1}_{\theta} \tilde{\Theta}
```

```math
V_d = \frac{1}{2} \tilde{d}^\top \Gamma^{-1}_{d} \tilde{d}
```

Where the $\Gamma$ matrix is a diagonal gain matrix for tuning the adaptive rate of the parameters. The reasoning behind inserting the adaptive parameters is that we want to ensure that the error, marked by the tilde, converges towards zero. To achieve this, we need to ensure that it actually does this by accounting for it in the Lyapunov function and controller.

Then we combine them like this:

```math
V = V_1 + V_2 + V_{\theta} + V_d
```

and now we will analyze the derivative of this CLF, and ensure convergence for the whole function.

```math
\dot{V} = \dot{V}_1 + z_2^\top M \dot{z}_2 + \tilde{\Theta}^\top \Gamma^{-1}_{\theta} \dot{\tilde{\Theta}} + \tilde{d}^\top \Gamma^{-1}_{d} \dot{\tilde{d}}
```

Before we write this out, we need to make some assumptions to make this more readable and easier to understand.

For $\dot{\tilde{\Theta}} = \dot{\hat{\Theta}} - \dot{\Theta}^\star$ we assume that the actual value has no changes, assuming it's static, and therefore the derivative $\dot{\Theta}^\star = 0$

2. The same condition holds for $\dot{\tilde{d}}$

```math
\dot{V} = \dot{V}_1 + z_2^\top M (\dot{\nu} - \dot{\alpha}) + \tilde{\Theta}^\top \Gamma^{-1}_{\theta} \dot{\hat{\Theta}} + \tilde{d}^\top \Gamma^{-1}_{d} \dot{\hat{d}}
```

```math
= \dot{V}_1 - z_2^\top M \dot{\alpha} + z_2^\top\tau - z_2^\top C(\nu)\,\nu + z_2^\top F(\nu, \Theta^\star) + z_2^\top d + \tilde{\Theta}^\top \Gamma^{-1}_{\theta} \dot{\hat{\Theta}} + \tilde{d}^\top \Gamma^{-1}_{d} \dot{\hat{d}}
```

```math
= - z_1^\top K_1z_1 + z_2^\top J(\eta)^\top z_1 - z_2^\top M \dot{\alpha} + z_2^\top \tau - z_2^\top C(\nu)\,\nu + z_2^\top Y(\nu) \Theta\star + z_2^\top d  + \tilde{\Theta}^\top \Gamma^{-1}_{\theta} \dot{\hat{\Theta}} + \tilde{d}^\top \Gamma^{-1}_{d} \dot{\hat{d}}
```

Since we only know the estimate of the adaptive parameters, we can write the controller in two parts:

```math
\tau = \tau_{controller} - F(\nu, \hat{\Theta}) - d = \tau_{controller} -Y(\nu) \hat{\Theta} - \hat{d}
```
Important to notice is that we introduce the estimate (^) for the variables, not the actual value (*).
We insert this into the system and get:

```math
= - z_1^\top K_1 z_1 + z_2^\top J(\eta)^\top z_1 - z_2^\top M \dot{\alpha} + z_2^\top \tau_{controller} - z_2^\top C(\nu)\,\nu - z_2^\top Y(\nu) (\hat{\Theta} - \Theta\star ) - z_2^\top (\hat{d} - d\star)  + \tilde{\Theta}^\top \Gamma^{-1}_{\theta} \dot{\hat{\Theta}} + \tilde{d}^\top \Gamma^{-1}_{d} \dot{\hat{d}}
```

We look at the adaptive parameters a little more and try to simplify them as much as possible

```math
\hat{\Theta} - \Theta^\star = \hat{\Theta} - (\hat{\Theta} - \tilde{\Theta}) = \tilde{\Theta} \newline
```
```math
\hat{d} - d^\star = \hat{d} - (\hat{d} - \tilde{d}) = \tilde{d}
```

Now we have:
```math
= - z_1^\top K_1 z_1 + z_2^\top J(\eta)^\top z_1 - z_2^\top M \dot{\alpha} + z_2^\top \tau_{controller} - z_2^\top C(\nu)\,\nu + (-z_2^\top Y(\nu) \tilde{\Theta}+ \tilde{\Theta}^\top \Gamma^{-1}_{\theta} \dot{\hat{\Theta}}) + (-z_2^\top \tilde{d} + \tilde{d}^\top \Gamma^{-1}_{d} \dot{\hat{d}})
```
From this we can separate out the terms with the adaptive parameters. We can write them up as two separate equations:

```math
-z_2^\top Y(\nu) \tilde{\Theta}+\tilde{\Theta}^\top \Gamma^{-1}_{\theta} \dot{\hat{\Theta}} = - \tilde{\Theta}^\top Y(\nu)^\top z_2 +\tilde{\Theta}^\top \Gamma^{-1}_{\theta} \dot{\hat{\Theta}}
```

```math
-z_2^\top \tilde{d} + \tilde{d}^\top \Gamma^{-1}_{d} \dot{\hat{d}} = - \tilde{d}^\top z_2+ \tilde{d}^\top \Gamma^{-1}_{d} \dot{\hat{d}}
```

We choose the \(\dot{\hat{\Theta}}\) and \(\dot{\hat{d}}\) to zero this out
```math
\boxed{
\dot{\hat{\Theta}} =  \Gamma_{\theta} Y(\nu)^\top z_2
}
```

```math
\boxed{
\dot{\hat{d}} = \Gamma_{d} z_2
}
```
Now that we have defined this we can insert and remove this from the equation, which should leave us with the normal system. An observation made during the construction of the controller was that the adaptive part and backstepping part is decoupled. Maybe this is dependent on the method used for the adaptive part, which is more of a MRAC type. Sadly, I don't have enough information about adaptive controllers to comment on this in detail.

```math
= - z_1^\top K_1 z_1 + z_2^\top J(\eta)^\top z_1 - z_2^\top M \dot{\alpha} + z_2^\top \tau_{controller} - z_2^\top C(\nu)\,\nu
```
```math
\tau_{controller} = -K_2 z_2 + M \dot{\alpha} + C(\nu)\nu - J(\eta)^\top z_1
```

Combined this gives us the control law:

```math
\boxed{
\tau = -K_2 z_2 + M \dot{\alpha} + C(\nu)\nu - J(\eta)z_1 - F(\nu, \hat{\Theta}) - \hat{d}
}
```
### Controller gains

The gains \(K_1\) and \(K_2\) are crucial for ensuring the stability and performance of the controller.

**\(K_1\)**: This gain matrix is associated with the outer loop stability, which primarily deals with the position and orientation errors (\(z_1\)). Proper tuning of \(K_1\) ensures that the position and orientation errors converge to zero, thereby stabilizing the outer loop.

```math
\begin{bmatrix}
k_{1,1} & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & k_{1,2} & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & k_{1,3} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & k_{1,4} & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & k_{1,5} & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & k_{1,6}
\end{bmatrix}
```

**\(K_2\)**: This gain matrix is related to the inner loop stability, which handles the velocity errors (\(z_2\)). Tuning \(K_2\) appropriately ensures that the velocity errors are minimized, stabilizing the inner loop.

```math
K_2 =
\begin{bmatrix}
k_{2,1} & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & k_{2,2} & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & k_{2,3} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & k_{2,4} & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & k_{2,5} & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & k_{2,6}
\end{bmatrix}
```

Together, \(K_1\) and \(K_2\) work to ensure that both the position/orientation and velocity errors are driven to zero, guaranteeing the overall stability and performance of the adaptive backstepping controller.

### Adaptive parameters and functions

Now that we have the proof for the control law, we need to look at the adaptive functions and parameters.

Since we wanted a damping (linear and nonlinear) \(Y(\nu)\) was chosen to be a 6x12 matrix with one linear and one nonlinear damping element:

```math
Y(\nu) =
\begin{bmatrix}
\nu[0] & \nu[0] |\nu[0]| & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & \nu[1] & \nu[1] |\nu[1]| & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \nu[2] & \nu[2] |\nu[2]| & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \nu[3] & \nu[3] |\nu[3]| & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \nu[4] & \nu[4] |\nu[4]| & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \nu[5] & \nu[5] |\nu[5]|
\end{bmatrix}
```

while the \(\hat{\Theta}\) will be a 12x1 vector:

```math
\hat{\Theta} =
\begin{bmatrix}
\alpha_1 & \beta_1 & \alpha_2 & \beta_2 & \alpha_3 & \beta_3 & \alpha_4 & \beta_4 & \alpha_5 & \beta_5 & \alpha_6 & \beta_6
\end{bmatrix}^\top
```

The \(\Gamma_{\Theta}\) will therefore be a 12x12 diagonal vector with the gains for the linear and nonlinear damping.

The disturbance \(d\) will have a 6x1 vector for the disturbance and uncertainty estimates:

```math
\hat{d} =
\begin{bmatrix}
d_1 & d_2 & d_3 & d_4 & d_5 & d_6
\end{bmatrix}^\top
```

#### Important information

The implementation of the controller requires \(\dot{\alpha}\) which is not that simple to calculate, given that this requires the derivative of the \(J(\eta)\) matrix.

```math
\dot{\alpha}
\;=\;
-\;J(\eta)^{-1}\,\dot{J}(\eta)\,J(\eta)^{-1}\bigl[- k_1\,(\eta - \eta_d)\bigr]
\;+\;
-J(\eta)^{-1} k_1\,\dot{\eta}
```

This was manually derived, and \(J(\eta)\) was also derived manually but here we can use a trick:

```math
J(\eta) =
\begin{bmatrix}
R & 0_{3x3} \\
0_{3x3} & T
\end{bmatrix}
```

where:
- \(R\) is the rotation matrix representing the orientation of the AUV.
- \(T\) is the transformation matrix for the translational components.
- \(0_{3x3}\) is a 3x3 zero matrix.

The derivative of \(J(\eta)\) can be expressed in terms of the derivatives of \(R\) and \(T\):

```math
\dot{J}(\eta) =
\begin{bmatrix}
\dot{R} & 0_{3x3} \\
0_{3x3} & \dot{T}
\end{bmatrix}
```

The trick is that \(\dot{R}\) can be written as:

```math
\dot{R} = R \cdot S \cdot r
```

where:
- \(R\) is the rotation matrix calculated from \(\eta\).
- \(S\) is the skew-symmetric matrix of the vector \((0, 0, 1)\).
- \(r\) is the z-component of the angular speed from \(\nu\).

For the \(T\) the expression needs to be manually calculated and this is not nice to look at:

```math
\dot{T}(\eta, \nu) =
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & \cos(\phi) \tan(\theta) \nu_x + \sin(\phi) \sec^2(\theta) \nu_y & -\sin(\phi) \tan(\theta) \nu_x + \cos(\phi) \sec^2(\theta) \nu_y \\
0 & -\sin(\phi) \nu_x & -\cos(\phi) \nu_x \\
0 & \cos(\phi) / \cos(\theta) \nu_x + \sin(\phi) \sin(\theta) / \cos^2(\theta) \nu_y & -\sin(\phi) / \cos(\theta) \nu_x + \cos(\phi) \sin(\theta) / \cos^2(\theta) \nu_y
\end{bmatrix}
```

This can be calculated by the chain rule and partial differentiation on \(\phi, \theta, \psi\):

```math
\dot{T}(\eta, \nu) = \frac{\partial T}{\partial \phi} \dot{\phi} + \frac{\partial T}{\partial \theta} \dot{\theta} + \frac{\partial T}{\partial \psi} \dot{\psi}
```

Here we could potentially use methods for estimating the derivative, but one of the benefits of this calculation is that we get good and accurate values for the rotation and translation derivatives. Instead of introducing more uncertainties as we try to remove this in the system with the adaptive part.

## Launch

To run the controller, use the ROS 2 launch file:
```bash
ros2 launch dp_adapt_backs_controller dp_adapt_backs_controller.launch.py
```

It's important to `colcon build` and `source install/setup.bash` before launching, or else it will not be launchable.

This will load the parameters from the provided YAML, start the node, and begin control operation.
