A handy ROS2 node to record data from acoustic PCB
Has the ability to display data live in real time
OBS!: Make sure the Acoustics Interface Node is running before starting acoustics recording node, otherwise you will be recording nothing :P

Use utilities/display_acoustics_data_live.py to display data in real time while it is being saved into the .csv file through the ROS2 node
(Very cool to look at, would recoment ;DDD)
