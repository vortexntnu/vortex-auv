# Waypoint Manager Tests

This package contains tests for the `waypoint_manager`.
Below are instructions for running all tests, running individual tests, and locating test artifacts.

---

## Running All Tests

To execute **all tests** in the package:

```bash
colcon test --packages-select waypoint_manager_test --event-handlers console_direct+
```

This will run every test executable and stream their output directly to your terminal.

---

## Running a Specific Test

To run **one specific test**, use `--ctest-args -R` with the **test executable name**.

> **Important:** CTest automatically prepends `test_` to test executables.
> So when matching with `-R`, you must include the `test_` prefix.

Example:

```bash
colcon test \
  --packages-select waypoint_manager_test \
  --ctest-args -R test_test_single_waypoint \
  --event-handlers console_direct+
```

This will run only the test executable matching the given regex.

---

## Test Output & Logs

After running tests, you can inspect results and artifacts in the build directory:

### ✔ **Test Results (JUnit, CTest logs)**

```
build/waypoint_manager_test/test_results/
```

### ✔ **Launch test terminal output**

(Generated by `launch_testing`)

```
build/waypoint_manager_test/launch_test/
```

### **Rosbag recordings (if enabled)**

(Currently: `bag=False`, so this folder may be empty)

```
build/waypoint_manager_test/rosbags/
```
